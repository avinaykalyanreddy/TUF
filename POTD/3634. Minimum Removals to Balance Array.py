You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

An array is considered balanced if the value of its maximum element is at most k times the minimum element.

You may remove any number of elements from nums​​​​​​​ without making it empty.

Return the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is balanced.

Note: An array of size 1 is considered balanced as its maximum and minimum are equal, and the condition always holds true.
