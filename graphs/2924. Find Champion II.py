"""
Problem Restated in Simple Words:

You have n teams (0 to n-1).

Youâ€™re given a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that shows who is stronger than whom.

An edge [u, v] means team u is stronger than team v.

A champion is a team that has no incoming edges â†’ meaning no other team is stronger than it.

ðŸ‘‰ If there is exactly one such team, return its number.
ðŸ‘‰ If there are zero or more than one, return -1.
