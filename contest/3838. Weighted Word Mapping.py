"""
You are given an array of strings words, where each string represents a word containing lowercase English letters.

You are also given an integer array weights of length 26, where weights[i] represents the weight of the ith lowercase English letter.

The weight of a word is defined as the sum of the weights of its characters.

For each word, take its weight modulo 26 and map the result to a lowercase English letter using reverse alphabetical order (0 -> 'z', 1 -> 'y', ..., 25 -> 'a').

Return a string formed by concatenating the mapped characters for all words in order.
