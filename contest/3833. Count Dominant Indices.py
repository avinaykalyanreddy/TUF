"""
You are given an integer array nums of length n.

An element at index i is called dominant if: nums[i] > average(nums[i + 1], nums[i + 2], ..., nums[n - 1])

Your task is to count the number of indices i that are dominant.

The average of a set of numbers is the value obtained by adding all the numbers together and dividing the sum by the total number of numbers.

Note: The rightmost element of any array is not dominant.
